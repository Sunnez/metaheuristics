# metaheuristics

My own work for the Metaheuristics course consisted on implementing the following algorithms:
* Brute Force Algorithm
* Simulated Annealing (SA)
* Simplex method
* Genetic Annealing (GA)
* Particle swarm optimization (PSO)

These algorithms have been tested on toy examples. 

Although some have been tried in the context of <strong>Google Challenge</strong>. More details on this competition below.

## Brute Force Algorithm on LP with hypercube constraint

## Simulated Annealing applied to non-convex optimization problem

## Simplex Method applied to linear programming

## Genetic Algorithm applied to Traveling Salesman Problem
