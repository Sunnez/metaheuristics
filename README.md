# metaheuristics

Following algorithms:
* Brute Force Algorithm
* Simulated Annealing (SA)
* Simplex method
* Genetic Annealing (GA)

These algorithms have been used on toy examples. Some have been tried in the context of Google Challenge. More details on this competition below.

## Brute Force Algorithm on LP with hypercube constraint

## Simulated Annealing applied to non-convex optimization problem

## Simplex Method applied to linear programming

## Genetic Algorithm applied Traveling Salesman Problem
