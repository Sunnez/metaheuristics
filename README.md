# metaheuristics

My own work for the Metaheuristics course consisted on implementing the following algorithms:
* Brute Force Algorithm
* Simulated Annealing (SA)
* Simplex method
* Genetic Annealing (GA)

These algorithms have been tested on toy examples. 

Although some have been tried in the context of Google Challenge. More details on this competition below.

## Brute Force Algorithm on LP with hypercube constraint

\underset{x\in \mathbb{R}^{n}}{\text{minimize}} \ \langle x,c \rangle \\
\text{s.t.}
\begin{cases}
& x_{i} \in \{0,1\}, \ i = 1...n \\
& \langle x,c \rangle \leq m \\
\end{cases}
